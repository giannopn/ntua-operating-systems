The sky hums with electric silence.
Raindrops fall like ticking clocks.
A bird flies backward, chasing its own shadow.
Whispers curl through the empty hallway.
Leaves dance without wind.
Time folds like paper cranes.
A cat blinks and the stars rearrange.
The moon tastes like forgotten dreams.
Streetlights flicker Morse code to no one.
Sand remembers every footstep.
The ocean sings lullabies in languages lost.
A tree grows upside down in my memory.
Clouds drift through the living room.
Mirrors hold conversations behind your back.
The sun rises twice, just to be sure.
Ink spills and forms ancient maps.
Laughter echoes from a place that doesn’t exist.
A key appears without a door.
Mountains breathe when no one’s watching.
Music grows on vines in the attic.
Books whisper secrets when unopened.
Colors drip off the edges of the world.
A clock ticks backward for fun.
Dreams are stored in jars under the bed.
Light bends to peek around corners.
A path appears where none had been.
Night wraps the earth in velvet hush.
Windows blink like sleepy eyes.
A feather floats against gravity.
And everything starts over again.
